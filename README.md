# 🧠 my-notes

Welcome to `my-notes` — my personal knowledge management system (KMS), second brain, and digital garden. This repository is where I ([@meitix](https://github.com/meitix)) document what I learn, explore ideas, and keep references for future me.

Whether it's software engineering, systems design, DevOps, neuroscience, philosophy, or just random insights — you'll find them all here, structured and searchable.

## 🌱 Why I Built This

Inspired by the [Second Brain](https://www.buildingasecondbrain.com/) concept, this repo is:

- A **learning log** for concepts I study
- A **reference hub** I can return to anytime
- A place to **connect ideas across domains**
- A tool to make thinking **tangible and revisitable**

It helps me:

- Learn actively by writing
- Remember more by organizing
- Build long-term personal knowledge
